# Phase 1 — ZMTP 3.1 Framing, Handshake, and Session Semantics

_From raw bytes to a correct ZeroMQ peer_

---

## 1. What Phase 1 Is (and Is Not)

Phase 1 answers one precise question:

> Can Monocoque speak **valid ZMTP 3.1** to a real `libzmq` peer without undefined behavior, silent drops, or deadlocks?

It is **not** about:

-   routing
-   load balancing
-   pub/sub
-   high-level socket behaviors

Those come later.

---

## 2. Architectural Principle: Sans-IO Session

The core abstraction introduced in Phase 1 is:

```
ZmtpSession
```

### Why Sans-IO?

-   no sockets
-   no async runtime
-   no allocation policy
-   no kernel interaction

It is a **pure state machine**:

```
Bytes in  →  State Transition  →  Events out
```

This separation is what allows:

-   deterministic testing
-   protocol correctness
-   reuse across runtimes

---

## 3. Session States

The session has **three states**, no more:

```text
Greeting → Handshake → Active
```

### 3.1 Greeting

-   exactly 64 bytes
-   parsed strictly
-   rejects malformed peers immediately

Key validations:

-   signature bytes
-   version (3.x)
-   mechanism name
-   as-server flag

**Failure here is terminal.**

---

### 3.2 Handshake (NULL mechanism)

Phase 1 supports **NULL only**, intentionally.

Why NULL first?

-   simplest
-   no crypto
-   still requires correct metadata
-   exposes many libzmq failure modes

#### Critical insight

`libzmq` will **silently drop peers** that:

-   omit READY
-   omit Socket-Type
-   send malformed properties

Monocoque explicitly prevents this class of bugs.

---

### 3.3 Active

Once handshake completes:

-   frame decoder is reused
-   no state reset
-   no buffer loss

From here on:

-   frames flow
-   commands are filtered
-   multipart is preserved

---

## 4. Framing Utilities (`utils.rs`)

Phase 1 introduced **strict framing helpers** to prevent protocol drift.

### 4.1 `encode_frame`

Encodes:

-   flags
-   short or long size
-   payload

Guarantees:

-   correct LONG bit
-   big-endian length
-   no accidental overflows

This ensures:

> Every byte on the wire matches ZMTP/37.

---

### 4.2 READY Builder

The **single most important handshake message**.

Mandatory properties enforced:

-   `Socket-Type`
-   optional `Identity`

Why this matters:

-   missing metadata = silent disconnect
-   misordered properties = silent disconnect
-   malformed sizes = silent disconnect

Monocoque never sends an invalid READY.

---

## 5. Session Events (Phase 1)

The session emits **explicit events**, never implicit behavior:

```text
SendBytes
Frame
Error
HandshakeComplete
```

### Why this matters

-   Actor decides what to do
-   Session never performs IO
-   No hidden side effects

This becomes essential in Phase 2 and 3.

---

## 6. HandshakeComplete: The Pivot Event

This event marks the exact moment when:

-   peer identity is known
-   peer socket type is known
-   routing becomes possible

Without this explicit event:

-   ROUTER/DEALER cannot work
-   PUB/SUB cannot attach subscriptions safely

This is the designed architectural hook.

---

## 7. Identity Ownership & Safety

### The problem

Peer identities often arrive as slices into read buffers.

Those buffers:

-   are slab-allocated
-   will be reused
-   **must not be referenced**

### The fix

On handshake completion:

```rust
Bytes::copy_from_slice(peer_identity)
```

This guarantees:

-   owned memory
-   stable lifetime
-   no dangling references

This is one of the most important memory-safety decisions in the project.

---

## 8. Interop: The “It’s Alive” Test

Phase 1 is validated against **real `libzmq`**, not mocks.

### Verified behaviors

-   Greeting exchange
-   NULL handshake
-   READY metadata correctness
-   Framed message exchange
-   No hangs
-   No silent drops

This proves:

> Monocoque is a **real ZMTP peer**, not a toy implementation.

---

## 9. Phase 1 Exit Criteria

Implementation will be complete when:

-   [ ] Valid ZMTP greeting
-   [ ] Valid NULL handshake
-   [ ] READY metadata correct
-   [ ] libzmq interop verified
-   [ ] No unsafe protocol shortcuts
-   [ ] Sans-IO session purity preserved

---

## 10. Why Phase 1 Was Harder Than It Looks

Most ZMQ re-implementations fail here because they:

-   skip READY
-   hardcode assumptions
-   leak buffer lifetimes
-   merge protocol and IO logic

Monocoque avoided all of these.

This is why Phase 2 was possible without refactoring.
